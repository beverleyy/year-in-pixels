## year-in-pixels-2021

Version 3 of the year-in-pixels page.

### New features this year include:

* Still no jQuery! Vanilla is superior, yo.
* A little more work with variables, getting the colors directly from the gradient bar.
* Life is tuff and I have depression so instead of writing down moods, I just have a rating scale that goes from 1 (bad) to 10 (good) now
* Day/night mode on automatic cause indecision is my life and I couldn't decide between black or white colors

I reused the instance of CORS-Anywhere that I set up for my professor's study (see the MOE2018TRF005 repo) since it is tied to my Github Pages domain. Yes, I am that lazy.

### Dependencies

* [PapaParse](http://www.papaparse.com)
* [CORS Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/)
