## year-in-pixels-2020

Version 2 of the year-in-pixels page.

### New features this year include:

* No more jQuery! Vanilla is superior, yo.
* I changed the color scheme to something more RGB
* Pixel fonts to match the pixel theme (Press Start 2P and Bitxmap)
* No more manually filling in the Javascript list, Papaparse and CORS-Anywhere lets this baby fetch data directly from a Google sheet
* Removed the month/day numbers and reorganized the grid into a month format
* And the old format is only a toggle switch away!

I reused the instance of CORS-Anywhere that I set up for my professor's study (see the MOE2018TRF005 repo) since it is tied to my Github Pages domain. Yes, I am that lazy.

### Dependencies

* [PapaParse](http://www.papaparse.com)
* [CORS Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/)
